# Welcome to the Brain Games!

Five math console games.
* brain-even - given a number, your task is to answer whether it is even or not
* brain-calc - an example is given that needs to be solved
* brain-gcd - find the common divisor of two numbers
* brain-prime - given a number, itâ€™s tedious to answer whether the number is prime or not
* brain-progression - tedious find missing number</br>

To win each game you need to answer 3 questions correctly
